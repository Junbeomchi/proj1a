# Deque
My attempt at Project 1A from CS61B Spring 2017 (Prior to officially taking the class).
The project involved implementing two separate, but identical, deques by using a circular doubly linked list data structure and a circular array list data structure.

The definition of deque for this project:
- data can be added only at the front or at the end.
- data can be removed only from the front or the end.
- data can be examined at any arbitrary position.
